Original Source: C5N\n\n\nNow, look at those bars: Argentina tests almost as many people as the USA! At least that’s what it seems like until you look at the numbers. Argentina tests 330 people per million, while the USA tests 7000. That is 20 times more, but the USA’s bar is only 1.2 times higher.\nThe graph makes Argentina look decent at testing people, while it’s clearly not the case. The TV channel arbitrarily manipulated the bars’ sizes with no regard for logic or rules of scaling. This is how the graph would look without manipulations.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nco2_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  country = c(\"Brasil\", \"Argentina\", \"EEUU\", \"Italia\", \"Alemania\", \"Norurga\"),\n  emission = c(256, 330, 7000, 14100, 15700, 22300)\n)\n\nco2_data$country &lt;- factor(co2_data$country, levels = co2_data$country)\n\ngg &lt;- ggplot(co2_data, aes(x = country, y = emission)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, color = \"skyblue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = emission), vjust = -0.3, hjust = -0.2, color = \"black\") +  # Add labels\n  labs(title = \"CO2 Emission by Country\",\n       x = \"Country\",\n       y = \"CO2 Emission\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\ngg\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can modify the graph into scatter plot for clear details. Now we can observe that Germany is not just 20 times more.\nAlthough, the graph indicates some variability in the relationship between the two variables. There is positive correlation between the data points.\nOn the x-axis the words of countries are specific to italian language. Which is difficult to understand by non-native speakers. So it is better to convert into english.\n\nInstead of scatter plot, we can convert into map and represent the test numbers so by just looking we can able to interpret the results.\n\nlibrary(leaflet)\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\n\n\ncovid_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  country = c(\"Brazil\", \"Argentina\", \"United States of America\", \"Italy\",\"Germany\",\"Norway\"),\n  tests = c(258, 330, 7000, 14100,15700,22300)\n)\n\n\nworld &lt;- ne_countries(returnclass = \"sf\")\n\n\nworld_with_co2 &lt;- merge(world, covid_data, by.x = \"name\", by.y = \"country\", all.x = TRUE)\n\n\nleaflet_map &lt;- leaflet(data = world_with_co2) %&gt;%\n  addTiles() %&gt;%\n  setView(lng = 0, lat = 0, zoom = 2) %&gt;%  # Set initial view of the map\n  addPolygons(\n    fillColor = ~colorQuantile(\"Reds\", tests)(tests),\n    fillOpacity = 0.7,\n    weight = 1,\n    popup = ~paste(name, \": \", tests, \" CO2 Emission (%)\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  addLegend(\n    position = \"bottomright\",\n    pal = colorQuantile(\"Reds\", covid_data$tests),\n    values = covid_data$tests,\n    title = \"Covid test results\"\n  )\n\n\nleaflet_map\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the map we can see the countries with less covid test are represented in light shade and countries with more covid tests are represented in dark shade."
