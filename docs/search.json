Here we can notice that the Group B has more refills. For instance, Group B is 5 times in 2015 than Group A. However, the graph is not properly visualized.\nThe following points must be considered for good visualization.\n\nThe graph uses 3D chart which does not add any value.\nThe y-Axis does not start with 0. Due to this it is difficult to know the true values.\nThe orientation of graph makes it difficult to see exact values for y-axis.\n\nImprovements:\n\nThe graph can be enhanced by converting it to 2-dimensional.\nBy changing the y-axis from 0.\nBy changing the orientation of graph\n\nThe graph can be redesigned as shown below:\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  Group = c(\"Group A\", \"Group A\", \"Group A\", \"Group A\", \"Group A\", \"Group B\", \"Group B\", \"Group B\", \"Group B\", \"Group B\"),\n  Year = c(\"CY 2010\", \"CY 2011\", \"CY 2012\", \"CY 2013\", \"CY 2014\", \"CY 2015\", \"CY 2016\", \"CY 2017\", \"CY 2018\", \"CY 2019\"),\n  Refills = c(14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 12, 10, 8, 6)\n)\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = Year, y = Refills, fill = Group)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(title = \"Refills by Year and Group\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Refills\",\n       fill = \"Group\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph uses a bar chart, which is an appropriate choice for comparing categories (years) and their corresponding values (refills).\nThe data labels (refill counts) are present above each bar, making it easy to see the specific values for each year.\nThe blue color used for the bars is visually appealing and generally easy to see against the white background.\n\nBut the spacing between the x-axis labels appears inconsistent, particularly between 2012 and 2013. This can make it visually misleading to compare\n\ncustom_palette &lt;- c(\"#1f78b4\", \"#33a02c\")\n\n# Create bar graph\nggplot(df, aes(x = Year, y = Refills, fill = Group)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_palette) +\n  labs(title = \"Refills by Year and Group\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Refills\",\n       fill = \"Group\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\nBy incorporating the required changes, we can create a graph that is more informative and easier to interpret for your audience. But Line charts provide a smoother visual representation of the data compared to the discrete bars in a bar chart. This can be helpful when the data points are closely spaced or when focusing on changes over time.\n\n# Create line graph\nggplot(df, aes(x = Year, y = Refills, color = Group, group = Group)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Refills by Year and Group\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Refills\",\n       color = \"Group\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\nLine charts effectively visualize trends over time or space due to the continuous line connecting data points. This makes it easier to identify patterns and changes in the data. The Line graph shows number of refills over year.\n\nIt can be see that for Group A the line is red and for Group B it is blue.\nThe Trend Line for group seems to be decreasing over increase in years and for Group B it initially increased from year 2015 to 2016 but thereon the refills by customers seems to be decreased.\n\nWe can conclude that, the refills per customer is decreasing from year to year but there is some event which caused it to spike from 2015 to 2016."
