Instead of scatter plot, we can convert into map and represent the test numbers so by just looking we can able to interpret the results.

```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(rnaturalearth)


covid_data <- data.frame(
  country = c("Brazil", "Argentina", "United States of America", "Italy","Germany","Norway"),
  tests = c(258, 330, 7000, 14100,15700,22300)
)


world <- ne_countries(returnclass = "sf")


world_with_co2 <- merge(world, covid_data, by.x = "name", by.y = "country", all.x = TRUE)


leaflet_map <- leaflet(data = world_with_co2) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  setView(lng = 0, lat = 0, zoom = 2) %>%  # Set initial view of the map
  addPolygons(
    fillColor = ~colorQuantile("Reds", tests)(tests),
    fillOpacity = 0.7,
    weight = 1,
    popup = ~paste(name, ": ", tests, " tests")
  ) %>%
  addLegend(
    position = "bottomright",
    pal = colorQuantile("Reds", covid_data$tests),
    values = covid_data$tests,
    title = "Covid test results"
  )


leaflet_map
```

With the map we can see the countries with less covid test are represented in light shade and countries with more covid tests are represented in dark shade.
